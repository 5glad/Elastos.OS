/**
 * The SpellCheckerSession interface provides the per client functionality of SpellCheckerService.
 *
 *
 * <a name="Applications"></a>
 * <h3>Applications</h3>
 *
 * <p>In most cases, applications that are using the standard
 * {@link android.widget.TextView} or its subclasses will have little they need
 * to do to work well with spell checker services.  The main things you need to
 * be aware of are:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Properly set the {@link android.R.attr#inputType} in your editable
 * text views, so that the spell checker will have enough context to help the
 * user in editing text in them.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For the rare people amongst us writing client applications that use the spell checker service
 * directly, you will need to use {@link #getSuggestions(TextInfo, int)} or
 * {@link #getSuggestions(TextInfo[], int, boolean)} for obtaining results from the spell checker
 * service by yourself.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Security</h3>
 *
 * <p>There are a lot of security issues associated with spell checkers,
 * since they could monitor all the text being sent to them
 * through, for instance, {@link android.widget.TextView}.
 * The Android spell checker framework also allows
 * arbitrary third party spell checkers, so care must be taken to restrict their
 * selection and interactions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here are some key points about the security architecture behind the
 * spell checker framework:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Only the system is allowed to directly access a spell checker framework's
 * {@link android.service.textservice.SpellCheckerService} interface, via the
 * {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_TEXT_SERVICE} permission.  This is
 * enforced in the system by not binding to a spell checker service that does
 * not require this permission.
 *
 * <li>The user must explicitly enable a new spell checker in settings before
 * they can be enabled, to confirm with the system that they know about it
 * and want to make it available for use.
 * </ul>
 *
