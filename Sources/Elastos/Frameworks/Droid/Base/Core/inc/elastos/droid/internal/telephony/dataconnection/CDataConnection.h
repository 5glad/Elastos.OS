 * This a class for representing a single data connection, with instances of this
 * class representing a connection via the cellular network. There may be multiple
 * data connections and all of them are managed by the <code>DataConnectionTracker</code>.
 *
 * A recent change is to move retry handling into this class, with that change the
 * old retry manager is now used internally rather than exposed to the DCT. Also,
 * bringUp now has an initialRetry which is used limit the number of retries
 * during the initial bring up of the connection. After the connection becomes active
 * the current max retry is restored to the configured value.
 *
 * NOTE: All DataConnection objects must be running on the same looper, which is the default
 * as the coordinator has members which are used without synchronization.
