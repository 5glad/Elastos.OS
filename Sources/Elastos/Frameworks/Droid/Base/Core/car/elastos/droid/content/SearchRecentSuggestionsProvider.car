     * This superclass can be used to create a simple search suggestions provider for your application.
     * It creates suggestions (as the user types) based on recent queries and/or recent views.
     *
     * <p>In order to use this class, you must do the following.
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>Implement and test query search, as described in {@link android.app.SearchManager}.  (This
     * provider will send any suggested queries via the standard
     * {@link android.content.Intent#ACTION_SEARCH ACTION_SEARCH} Intent, which you'll already
     * support once you have implemented and tested basic searchability.)</li>
     * <li>Create a Content Provider within your application by extending
     * {@link android.content.SearchRecentSuggestionsProvider}.  The class you create will be
     * very simple - typically, it will have only a constructor.  But the constructor has a very
     * important responsibility:  When it calls {@link #setupSuggestions(String, int)}, it
     * <i>configures</i> the provider to match the requirements of your searchable activity.</li>
     * <li>Create a manifest entry describing your provider.  Typically this would be as simple
     * as adding the following lines:
     * <pre class="prettyprint">
     *     &lt;!-- Content provider for search suggestions --&gt;
     *     &lt;provider android:name="YourSuggestionProviderClass"
     *               android:authorities="your.suggestion.authority" /&gt;</pre>
     * </li>
     * <li>Please note that you <i>do not</i> instantiate this content provider directly from within
     * your code.  This is done automatically by the system Content Resolver, when the search dialog
     * looks for suggestions.</li>
     * <li>In order for the Content Resolver to do this, you must update your searchable activity's
     * XML configuration file with information about your content provider.  The following additions
     * are usually sufficient:
     * <pre class="prettyprint">
     *     android:searchSuggestAuthority="your.suggestion.authority"
     *     android:searchSuggestSelection=" ? "</pre>
     * </li>
     * <li>In your searchable activities, capture any user-generated queries and record them
     * for future searches by calling {@link android.provider.SearchRecentSuggestions#saveRecentQuery
     * SearchRecentSuggestions.saveRecentQuery()}.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <div class="special reference">
     * <h3>Developer Guides</h3>
     * <p>For information about using search suggestions in your application, read the
     * <a href="{@docRoot}guide/topics/search/index.html">Search</a> developer guide.</p>
     * </div>
     *
     * @see android.provider.SearchRecentSuggestions
