aapt
   -0  specifies an additional extension for which such files will not
       be stored compressed in the .apk.  An empty string means to not
       compress any files at all.

eg:
aapt package -f -0 .dat -S res -A assets -I /home/wanli/RDKM1/ElastosRDK4_2_2/Build/Emulator/android_sdk/platforms/android-17/android.jar -M AndroidManifest.xml -F data/hello.apk
